### Hello World 👋
I am Pratik Devnani,  a graduate student at NC state with majors in Computer Science. I am a software developer, data scientist and machine learning engineer. I enjoy working as a back-end developer and I always strive to expand my knowledge base with each and every task that I work on.

I am currently interning at CIPM where I have been tasked maintaining multiple databases and linking them for different projects and websites that we develop! My subtask includes creating documentation for existing legacy database structure, creating a new and concise structures that can be accessed efficiently and linking these databases to our front-end solution.
